# 🚨 Prompt Injection via Hidden HTML Comment

## 🧠 Summary

This test simulates a real-world prompt injection vector in which the attacker hides malicious instructions inside an HTML comment block (`<!-- ... -->`).

Even though HTML comments are not meant to be displayed, many LLMs **still parse the full input**, including what appears inside comments — especially in markdown-to-text pipelines.

This can cause the model to **override its default behavior**, ignore safety instructions, or hallucinate unintended outputs.

## 🔬 Behavior Observed

| Safe Mode     | Output Behavior                                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OFF**       | Echoes prompt fully, including hidden instruction.              |
| **ON**        | Keyword `ignore` is sanitized → replaced with `[BLOCKED]`.      |

## 📊 Risk Analysis

| Metric             | Value                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Exploitability     | Easy                                   |
| Impact             | Moderate to High                       |
| Defense Complexity | Moderate                               |
| Affected Systems   | Markdown renderers, HTML pipelines, RAG-based UIs |
| Model Behavior     | GPT-4 and Claude have shown parsing behavior in some contexts |

## 🛡️ Recommendations

- Do not pass **raw HTML or markdown** directly to LLM prompts.
- Strip or sanitize comment blocks before constructing prompt input.
- Use **role-based prompt structuring** (e.g., system/user roles).
- Apply input/output **moderation APIs** for filtering risky tokens.

---

## ✅ Lab Result Summary

- ✅ Injection **succeeds** when Safe Mode is OFF.
- ✅ Injection is **blocked** when Safe Mode is ON via `sanitize_input()`.
