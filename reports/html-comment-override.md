# ðŸš¨ Prompt Injection via Hidden HTML Comment

## ðŸ§  Summary
This test simulates a real-world prompt injection vector in which the attacker hides malicious instructions inside an HTML comment block (`<!-- ... -->`). 

Even though HTML comments are not meant to be displayed, many LLMs **still parse the full input**, including what appears inside comments â€” especially in markdown-to-text pipelines.

This can cause the model to **override its default behavior**, ignore safety instructions, or hallucinate unintended outputs.
